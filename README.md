# Welcome to GLM Risk Modeling

The Generalized Linear Models are extensively applied by insurance companies to model the risks. I created this repository to demonstrate how to exploit GLM to predict the number of claims using the home insurance data.

The general process is to first determine the distribution of the dependent variable, here nClaims. Then, use log maximum likelihood method to regress the independent variables. Finally, check coefficients and the deviance to determine whether to add another variable or not.
